## Usage of Redux

For a small project like this one, i typically would have used React's context api for state management as redux is an overkill, however, i chose to go with redux inorder to show my level of comfortability with it as it is the most used library for state management.

## Assumption

1. I am assuming the API key that has been provided is not secret.
